##  Task 1.1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

### **Problem Statement**
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. Performs the following basic mathematical operations:
   - Addition  
   - Subtraction  
   - Multiplication  
   - Division  
3. Displays the result of each operation.

### **Expected Output**
The output should display the result of all operations, for example:
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0

   🧩 Task 2.1:  Check if a Number is Even or Odd
📄 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

Takes an integer input from the user.

Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.

Displays the result accordingly.

💻 Code Explanation

The program takes input from the user using input().

It checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator %.

If the number is divisible by 2, it prints "Even", otherwise it prints "Odd".

🧠 Concepts Used

Conditional statements (if-else)

Arithmetic operator (%)

User input and output

Terminal operator




🔢 Task 2.2: Sum of Integers from 1 to N Using a Loop
📄 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 up to 50.

Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.

Displays the final sum.

💻 Code Explanation

The program initializes a variable total = 0.

It takes input n (the upper limit) from the user.

Using a for loop, it iterates from 1 to n and keeps adding each number to total.

Finally, it displays the total sum.

🧠 Concepts Used

Loops (for)

Arithmetic addition (+=)

Range function

User input and output

I used the range to take input from user and find the sum of all the digits instead of only 50 digits
