# Assignment 3: Module 4 - Functions & Modules in Python

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 3** of Module 4: *Functions & Modules in Python*. The assignment covers the following tasks:

1. Calculating factorial using a user-defined function.
2. Using the Python `math` module for various mathematical calculations.

Both programs demonstrate the use of functions, loops/recursion, user input, and built-in Python modules.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**Problem Statement:**
- Define a function named `factorial` that takes a number as input.
- Calculate its factorial using either a loop or recursion.
- Return the calculated factorial.
- Call the function with a sample number and print the output.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**Problem Statement:**
This program asks the user to input a number and then performs the following calculations using Python's built-in `math` module:

1. **Square Root** – Calculates the square root of the number.
2. **Natural Logarithm** – Calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of the number.
3. **Sine** – Calculates the sine of the number in **radians**.

The program then displays all the results in a readable format.

**Example Usage:**
